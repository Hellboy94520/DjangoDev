# DjangoDev
This is my Django developpement.

My Main project is to modernize a website named NetLiens.com. Since I began development, I wanted to learn website development but without a goal, it was difficult to began. One day, I met NetLiens owner who purposes to me to update his website that has performance problem. This one was produced in 2003 and never upgrade since this time. So, i decided to accept and start the project. 
After many discussions, we decided to rebuild totaly the website and just keep the database (it actualy size is 1Gb !). First of all, i have to convert the old MySQL database into a powerful MangoDB database. After that, I have to build entirely the website with the Django Framework. This one will allow me to learn, in the same time, python language.
